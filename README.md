Hello, my name is Luke Dawson.

I am currently working towards a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Wright State University.

This semester, I will be learning Data Structures and Algorithms, and learning how to implement them to write more efficient and effective programs.
I am also currently learning about Cyber Network Security and using it to make applications that are safe and secure.
